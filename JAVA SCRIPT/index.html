    <h1>JavaScript</h1>
    <p> JS is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming language with first-class
        functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments
        also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm,
        single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional
        programming) styles.

        JavaScript's dynamic capabilities include runtime object construction, variable parameter lists, function
        variables, dynamic script creation (via eval), object introspection (via for...in and Object utilities), and
        source-code recovery (JavaScript functions store their source text and can be retrieved through toString()).

        This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not the parts that are specific to Web pages or
        other host environments. For information about APIs that are specific to Web pages, please see Web APIs and DOM.

        The standards for JavaScript are the ECMAScript Language Specification (ECMA-262) and the ECMAScript
        Internationalization API specification (ECMA-402). As soon as one browser implements a feature, we try to
        document it. This means that cases where some proposals for new ECMAScript features have already been
        implemented in browsers, documentation and examples in MDN articles may use some of those new features. Most of
        the time, this happens between the stages 3 and 4, and is usually before the spec is officially published.

        Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language â€” JavaScript is not "Interpreted Java". Both "Java"
        and "JavaScript" are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the
        two programming languages have very different syntax, semantics, and use.

        JavaScript documentation of core language features (pure ECMAScript, for the most part) includes the following:

        The JavaScript guide
        The JavaScript reference
        For more information about JavaScript specifications and related technologies, see JavaScript technologies
        overview.

        For complete beginners
        Head over to our Learning Area JavaScript topic if you want to learn JavaScript but have no previous experience
        with JavaScript or programming. The complete modules available there are as follows:

        JavaScript first steps
        Answers some fundamental questions such as "what is JavaScript?", "what does it look like?", and "what can it
        do?", along with discussing key JavaScript features such as variables, strings, numbers, and arrays.

        JavaScript building blocks
        Continues our coverage of JavaScript's key fundamental features, turning our attention to commonly-encountered
        types of code blocks such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and events.</p>
