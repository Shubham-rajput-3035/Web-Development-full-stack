        The String object is used to represent and manipulate a sequence of characters.

        Description
        Strings are useful for holding data that can be represented in text form. Some of the most-used operations on
        strings are to check their length, to build and concatenate them using the + and += string operators, checking
        for the existence or location of substrings with the indexOf() method, or extracting substrings with the
        substring() method.

        Creating strings
        Strings can be created as primitives, from string literals, or as objects, using the String() constructor:

        JS
        Copy to Clipboard

        const string1 = "A string primitive";
        const string2 = 'Also a string primitive';
        const string3 = `Yet another string primitive`;
        JS
        Copy to Clipboard
    

        const string4 = new String("A String object");
        String primitives and string objects share many behaviors, but have other important differences and caveats. See
        "String primitives and String objects" below.

        String literals can be specified using single or double quotes, which are treated identically, or using the
        backtick character `. This last form specifies a template literal: with this form you can interpolate
        expressions. For more information on the syntax of string literals, see lexical grammar.

        Character access
        There are two ways to access an individual character in a string. The first is the charAt() method:</p>
